# Sentiment Bot API

The Sentiment Bot API is an AI-powered API that analyzes the sentiment of text input and provides a sentiment score indicating whether the text is positive, negative, or neutral.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the Sentiment Analysis API on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run the Sentiment Bot API, you need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 10 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-api.git
   cd sentiment-analysis-api
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the API

To start the Sentiment Bot API, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The API will start running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Usage

### Analyzing Sentiment

Endpoint: `POST /analyze-sentiment`

This endpoint accepts a JSON payload with the following structure:

```json
{
  "text": "The text to be analyzed"
}
```

#### Request

- HTTP Method: POST
- Content-Type: application/json

Example request using cURL:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text":"I love this API! It's amazing!"}' http://localhost:3000/analyze-sentiment
```

#### Response

Example response:

```json
{
  "sentiment": "positive"
}
```

Possible sentiment values: `"positive"`, `"negative"`, `"neutral"`.

### Error Handling

If there is an error during the sentiment analysis process or the request payload is missing required fields, the API will respond with an appropriate error message and status code.

## Customization and Extension

You can extend the functionality of the Sentiment Analysis API to suit your specific needs. Some potential areas for customization and extension include:

- Adding additional endpoints or API functionalities.
- Enhancing the sentiment analysis algorithm with more advanced techniques.
- Implementing authentication and access control mechanisms.
- Integrating the API with other services or databases.
